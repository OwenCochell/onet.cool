                <h1>Welcome to ONet!</h1>

                <p>My name is Owen Cochell.
                    I'm just a fellow human who enjoys working with and using computers
                    (Maybe a little too much).
                    I like to fancy myself as a semi-competent software developer,
                    but you can be the judge of that.
                    I work on a lot of random stuff, some hardware related,
                    others math related, and even more so software related.
                    If you can't tell already, i'm kind of a <s>no-life</s> super cool guy!
                </p>
                <p>ONet contains info about myself, my projects, and other random things
                    that find their way onto this site.
                    This site will(hopefully) be updated semi-regularly,
                    so keep an eye out for new content.
                    Maybe you find something of worth here!
                </p>
                <p>This website is my attempt at learning basic web development
                    (and a touch of  system administration),
                    so please excuse any poorly designed components.

                    into creating revenue based off data collection and analytics,
                    because that's just creepy and weird.
