                    <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        mctools is a library that offers python implementations of common Minecraft protocols
                        such as: RCON, Query, Server List Ping.
                        mctools allows developers to interact with Minecraft servers in a meaningful way,
                        without being too complicated.
                        It also provides methods for formatting Minecraft color codes,
                        so the end user does not have to.
                        mctools also has a CLI tool that allows users to start an RCON session, query, and Ping 
                        running Minecraft servers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

                    <p>
                        I actually have really big plans for mctools!
                        The first action I would like to take is to add in mixins
                        that make server administration via RCON much simpler.
                        This would mean building functions that do certain tasks into mctools.

                        For example, if you want to ban a player via RCON, 
                        you would invoke mctools like so:
                    </p>

                    <code>client.command("ban [PLAYER]")</code>

                    <p>
                        Assume that <code>client</code> is an instantiated RCON client that is successfully authenticated,
                        and <code>[PLAYER]</code> is the name of a player we wish to ban.
                        This is fine and dandy, but it can be better!
                        Eventually, I would like to see something like this:
                    </p>

                    <code>client.ban("[PLAYER]"")</code>

                    <p>
                        As you can see, the functionality is built into mctools clients,
                        allowing for a more pythonic way of doing certain tasks.
                        Of course, all vanilla commands would be included,
                        but I don't want to stop there.
                        I also want to include mixins for 3rd party plugins,
                        which would allow advanced tasks to be done easily.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would also like to somewhat automate this process by automatically
                        pulling all valid commands and arguments from the remote server.
                        This would not only allow mixins to be automatically generated,
                        but it would also allow for RCON autocomplete,
                        which would be a very powerful feature.
                        mctools would also offer official mixins that won't 
                        have the 'quirks' of generated ones.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Some other tasks would be better error handling,
                        actual testing, SSH forwarding for secure RCON,
                        and maybe a custom server plugin that helps mctools 
                        understand the server and it's commands. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All this is very possible!
                        However, implementing these features can get really messy,
                        as there are many server implementations and plugins that have their own 
                        quirks that I have to work around.
                        Until the huge RCON update comes,
                        this mctools will continue to be maintained,
                        and any bugs that arise will be corrected.

                    <summary>cursepy</summary>

                    <a href="https://github.com/OwenCochell/cursepy">Project Page</a>
                    <a href="https://cursepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Documentation</a>

                    <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        cursepy is a library that offers python entry points into the 
                        <a href="https://curseforge.com/">CurseForge(CF)</a> API,
                        allowing python programs to interact with CF.
                        cursepy's goal is to be very simple for developers who want something that 'just works',
                        and heavily customizable for developers who have very specific use cases.
                        cursepy uses a modular approach to interacting with CF,
                        meaning that every request is tied to a handler that gets info from somewhere.
                        This was necessary as CF does not have an official API,
                        meaning that any component of any given entry point can be shut down completely
                        or partially at any given moment.
                        The handler based approach allows for functionality to be swapped in and out easily.
                        And when used with the cusepy Handler Framework(CHF),
                        handler development becomes quick and easy,
                        which is crucial for quickly writing new handlers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

                    <p>
                        cursepy is still a work in progress.
                        The docs are still being edited as we speak,
                        but their core content will remain the same; it will only be re-phrased.
                        cursepy is still receiving some code changes,
                        but nothing too major.
                        I am still working out some issues wil CF's backend,
                        as cursepy can't reliably fetch plugin info. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Future goals would defiantly be implementing
                        more backends.
                        I have my eyes on a few 3rd party ones
                        (I will be contacting the owners of these services
                        to ensure implementing them will be okay),
                        and I have been attempting to dig deeper into CF backends.
                        In the end though,
                        cursepy will be the backend for a larger projects,
                        this being a open source CLI package manager
                        (kinda like <a href="https://multimc.org/">MultiMC</a>,
                        but for the command line, and geared more towards servers.)
                        that will allow for mods/plugins to be automatically installed
                        and maintained, so the sysadmin(Me) does not have to! 
                    </p>

                    <p>Stay tuned for future updates on cusepy and my package manager!</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>
                        python-audio-synth(Name still pending...) is a modular open source audio synthesizer written in python.
                        Users can connect modular components together to create sounds.
                        These components range from oscillators, filters, amplitude scalers, synths(FM, AM).
                        We also offer components that can change over time, such as envelopes(ADSR for example),
                        linear/exponential ramps, LFOs.
                        They can be attached to parameters on other components,
                        for example a LFO can be attached to the 'amp' parameter on the amplitude scaler,
                        which will cause the loudness of the wave to 'warble'.
                        PAS offers many components that alter the properties of waves,
                        which allows for complex voices to be made.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        PAS also has a built in sequencer, 
                        which allows voices to be toggled on and off programmably.
                        It provides easy to use entry point methods for toggling notes
                        and other events, and allows for multi-channel sequencing,
                        meaning that the sequencer can control multiple voices at once. 
                        The PAS sequencer is also modular,
                        which allows functionality and musical protocols to be easily added.
                        The sequencer currently support basic MIDI through ALSA,
                        music marco language, and ASCII Music(A simple protocol of my own design using ASCII characters).
                        Variable speed event playback is also supported!
                        We also offer convenience methods and classes to simplify working with 
                        musical notes and rhythms.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

                    <p>
                        I have <i>HUGE</i> plans for PAS!
                        As of now, PAS is a simple toy for working with audio and waves,
                        but I would eventually like to turn it into a fully fledged tool.
                        I would like to implement most synth components, 
                        as well as methods to create sounds(FM, AM, wavetable).
                        I'm also working on adding more modules to the sequencer
                        to support more musical protocols
                        (Keep an eye of for an external MIDI library!).
                        Finally, I will be porting some math-heavy operations to C,
                        as python simply is not fast enough for what I am trying to do.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Someday I would like to see PAS as a viable option for python developers
                        to use when creating complex sounds in projects.
                        I would also like to see PAS used in a performance/musical production context.
                        Specifically in the field of music generation
                        (the process of creating music from random data),
                        as that concept greatly interests me.
                        Until then, PAS will remain a fun little toy,
                        and will probably be one of my long term projects.

                    <a href="https://github.com/OwenCochell/chas">Project Page</a>

                    <p>
                        Computerized Home Automation System(chas) has been a passion project of mine since Freshman year of High School.
                        chas is a modular, open source home automation framework that seeks to simplify home automation.
                        I have always found home assistants to be awesome, but I dislike the privacy risks they introduce
                        (I'm looking at you Amazon/Google).
                        chas is my attempt at replacing other home assistants,
                        and has the potential to emulate most(if not all) features offered by mainstream home assistants.
                        chas also respects your privacy, unlike some other companies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        chas has many components and features including, but not limited to:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom socket server/protocol for server to node communication</li>
                        <li>Wrappers for popular voice recognition engines</li>
                        <li>Plugin system for adding functionality</li>
                        <li>Custom nCurses wrappers for front end development</li>
                        <li>WAV file reader/streamer</li>
                        <li>And many more...</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

                    <p>
                        I have <i>MASSIVE</i> plans for chas!
                        I would like chas to eventually become a viable home automation solution. 
                        chas still has many issues, the first being it's messy codebase.
                        I started work on chas when I was very inexperienced,
                        and I didn't really know what I was doing
                        (I still don't know what I am doing, but I knew even less back then).
                        This means that chas was a huge catalyst for me,
                        encouraging me to learn complex concepts like networking, modular design,
                        audio files, nCurses front end development, ect.
                        In a way, I owe this project a lot,
                        as it really pushed me to the point where I am now.
                        While this is a nice sentiment,
                        it still does not change the fact that my first implementations
                        of these features were god awful.
                        What chas needs most is a re-write and a spit-shine,
                        which I will hopefully be doing in the near future.
                        I will also be adding more features to chas as time goes on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        chas needs a lot of work, 
                        and it will probably be one of my long term projects.
                        It will always hold a special place in my heart though,
                        as it is one of my first steps into the world of computer science.

                        (Like <a href="https://www.nethack.org/">NetHack</a>)?
                        AG seeks to simply game development in this field!
                        We offer nCurses wrappers for easy curses development(I actually ripped them straight from chas),
                        a modular tilemap that allows entities to interact with each other,
                        AI autoruns that allow for entity pathfinding,
                        and a custom audio engine for playing sounds and music
                        (Again, pulled this from PAS).
                        AG is a work in progress, and is nowhere near completion.
                        It is this reason why there is no project link.
                        I am working on this project with a few good friends,
                        so when we deem it appropriate, we will release this project to the world!

                        PaperMC-Update is a very simple python script

                        server install.
                        It automatically pulls version info from the current installed
                        server, or you can manually specify it if you wish.
                        It also allows you to select the version/build you want installed.

                        I don't have any future plans for PaperMC-Update,
                        as it is just a simple update script.
                        I will continue to update it and patch any bugs as they arise.

                    <p>
                        Dynamic Insult System(DIS) is a python project that randomly creates insults.
                        It is designed to be lightweight, so it can be ported to many platforms.
                        As of now, DIS is only ported to Discord as a server bot.
                        DIS is not available as of now, and is only implemented in my personal servers.
                        DIS allows for it's wordlist to be altered during runtime,
                        and it also supports a word expansion engine called DIS Insult Notation(DIN).

                    <h2>Future Plans</h2>

                    <p>
                        I would really like to release DIS to the world!
                        DIS still needs some backend work,
                        and I would like to add more insult generators.
                        I will probably not be hosting DIS on my own machines,
                        but I will provide instructions on how to host it yourself.
                        I will also need to find a new discord backend, as the 'discord.py'
                        library is now defunct.

                        libkahoot is a python library that allows for applications to interact with Kahoot games.
                        It offers a modular backend, which allows you to assign handlers to certain events.
                        This allows you to create applications that react and interact with Kahoot games.
                        It also allowed you to do some neat things like bypass two-factor authentication,
                        as well as the name generator.
                        libkahoot was primarily designed for bot development,
                        but you could also use to create custom clients
                        (I believe libkahoot has handlers that allow games to be played from the command line, for example).

                    <p>
                        High School Freshman me was obsessed with botting of all kinds, 
                        and he though that Kahoot botting was particularly enjoyable,
                        as my school used Kahoot for many activities.
                        These days however, I am not as interested in such activities.
                        This means that libkahoot will probably not be receiving any major changes or overhauls
                        in the near future.
                        This is not to say that libkahoot will <i>never</i> receive updates,
                        but for now libkahoot will remain dormant.
                        I am not currently testing libkahoot,
                        so I do not know if it even still works!
